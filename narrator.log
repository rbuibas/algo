ARRAYS

1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?
START: 1/24/2019 2:01:33 PM

	Ideas:
	1. sort array and pass through it (must if there are duplicates)
	2. use an additional array
	3. use the sume of elements (only works for finding ONE missing number)

	JS pain points:
	# initializing array in js
		just do it with array = []
	# filling array with some value
		can do it with Array.prototype.fill, but there might be some Browser issues and also it fills with a static value,
		so if you think to use it to fill with different instances of an object, think again.
	# ternary operator and expressions
	# reduce on array in JS
	# JS array sorting
	# for..in vs for..of


	JAVA pain points
	# reduce on a stream in Java (different than JS)
		ex: Arrays.stream(intArray).reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b); //sum
		ex2: Arrays.stream(intArray).reduce(0, Integer::sum); //sum
	# print an array
		can't use array.toString, rather Arrays.toString(array);

2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?
START: 1/24/2019 3:30:32 PM

	Ideas:
	1. Sort array, go through it and get the duplicates (store them in a Map)
	2. Pass through array and put all the values into a Map

	JS pain points:
	# how to declare a Map
		let someMap = new Map();
		// remember, no types in JS, so no: Map someMap = new Map();
	# Array.prototype.push and pop

	JAVA pain points:
	# sorting an array:
		Arrays.sort(array); // no return
	# dynamic array (i.e. how big should I make the second array)
	# List to array

3. How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array? 

START: 1/24/2019 4:49:51 PM

	Ideas:
	1. Sort it and look (nah)
	2. Assign smallest and largest to be 0, iterate and change accordingly.

	JS Paint points:
	# when using reduce don't forget to return

4. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

START: 1/24/2019 5:07:37 PM

	Ideas:
	1. Classic - nested loops, calculate, store (O^n)
	2. !! Should use a Set to add the values as we go and compare to the expected value for the sum at the same time
	3. !! Sort array, use two pointers:
		- if sum satisfies, print
		- if sum is less, increase left pointer
		- if sum is greater, decrease right pointer

4": How do you reverse String in Java ? How about C ?

START: 1/24/2019 5:53:45 PM

	Ideas:
	1. StringBuffer reverse (ofc)
	2. toCharArray() and do magic
	3. [C] Let's see
	4. Recursive ?!

	JAVA Paint points:
	# char[] to String is done: new String(charArray);


LINKED LISTS

1. How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?

	Ideas:
	1. Use two pointer, the second gets incremented every second pass; use while

2. How do you check if a given linked list contains a cycle? How do you find the starting node of the cycle?

START: 1/25/2019 9:39:19 AM

	Ideas:
	1. Parse the list, add elements to a Set; if already added, it's the linked list cycle culprit
	2. [SOLUTION] Use fast and slow pointer, one advances by two, if they meet, the list is cyclic.

	JS Pain points:
	# how create classes and add methods/functions to them

	JAVA Pain points:
	# separation between Node and the LinkedList implementation

3. How do you reverse a linked list? 

START: 1/25/2019 11:16:24 AM

	Ideas:
	1. Use a temp variable
	2. Recursive
